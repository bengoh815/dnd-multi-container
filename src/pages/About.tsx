          <p>
            One of the biggest challenges when learning{" "}
            <strong>@dnd-kit</strong> is finding clean, real-world examples â€”
            especially for <strong>multi-container drag and drop</strong>. Most
            demos and tutorials focus on single-column lists or basic item
            sorting.
          </p>

          <p>
            This project aims to fill that gap by demonstrating how to build a{" "}
            <strong>Kanban-style interface</strong> where items can be:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>ðŸ§² Dragged across multiple containers</li>
            <li>ðŸ“¦ Reordered within each container</li>
            <li>ðŸ§  Tracked using normalized data formats</li>
            <li>
              âš¡ Reactively updated during <code>onDragOver</code> and committed
              in <code>onDragEnd</code>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            This project acts as a bridge between simple list sorting and
            production-grade Kanban boards. It's structured to be both{" "}
            <strong>educational</strong> and <strong>extensible</strong>, with
            clean separation of state, data modeling, and UI.
          </p>

          <p>
            Whether you're building a productivity app, a project planner, or
            just exploring advanced drag-and-drop patterns â€” I hope this helps
            make the journey smoother.
